Stanford undergrad. Columbia MBA + MS in AI/ML. Based in NYC.

## What I've Shipped

**[Sales Enablement Plugin](https://github.com/jbalbu01/sales-enablement-plugin)** — A Claude plugin with 18 skills, 7 slash commands, and 16 MCP tools that learns from every deal. Integrates HubSpot, Gong, Slack, ZoomInfo, and Clay. Self-healing content that flags itself when it goes stale.

**[Sales Intelligence MCP Server](https://github.com/jbalbu01/sales-intelligence-mcp-server)** — Open-source TypeScript server (MIT) connecting Claude to Gong, ZoomInfo, Clay, and LinkedIn Sales Navigator. 16 tools for prospect research, call transcripts, lead enrichment, and org charts.

**Sophie** — AI voice agent that handles live sales conversations and generates post-call intelligence reports. Built on GPT-4o, Claude Haiku, ElevenLabs, and Twilio. Runs at ~$0.03/session.

**Sequence Generator** — Prospect discovery to multi-channel outbound in under 60 seconds. Pulls from Apollo's 270M+ contacts, enriches with Hunter.io, and generates personalized sequences with AI.
